QJL (Quantized Johnson-Lindenstrauss) Transform for MLX

The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma states that points in high-dimensional space
can be projected into lower dimensions while approximately preserving distances.

QJL quantizes this projection to 1 bit (sign only), achieving:
- Zero memory overhead (no quantization constants per block)
- Unbiased inner product estimation
- Near-optimal rate-distortion tradeoff

Key insight: For random projection matrix P, the inner product <x,y> can be
approximated using sign(Px) and sign(Py) with proper scaling.

    RaBitQ-style inner product bias correction via (π/2) scaling.

    This is the simpler alternative to TurboQuant's two-stage QJL residual
    approach. For 1-bit sign quantization, the expected inner product is biased
    by a known constant factor of (2/π). Multiplying by (π/2) removes this bias.

    Trade-off vs QJL residual:
    - Simpler: zero extra memory, one multiply
    - Higher variance: amplifies noise by (π/2)² ≈ 2.47×
    - Equivalent bias removal: both produce unbiased estimators

    The TurboQuant paper (ICLR 2026) claims its residual approach is superior
    because it reduces variance. This is mathematically correct — but the
    RaBitQ authors (Gao et al., SIGMOD 2025) note that the scaling correction
    is the standard approach and sufficient for most retrieval tasks.
