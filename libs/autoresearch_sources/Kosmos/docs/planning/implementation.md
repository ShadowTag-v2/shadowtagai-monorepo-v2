# World Model Implementation Guide (Full Architecture Path)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** November 2025
**Status:** Implementation Ready
**Owner:** Kosmos Development Team

---

## ⚡ **Choose Your Implementation Path**

You have **two options** for implementing persistent knowledge graphs:

### 🚀 **MVP-First Path** (Recommended for most teams)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to production
- **Document:** [`implementation_mvp.md`](implementation_mvp.md)
- **Approach:** Ship minimal viable persistence, validate with users, evolve based on feedback
- **Best for:** Delivering value quickly, validating demand, iterating

### 🏗️ **This Document: Full Architecture Path**
- **Timeline:** 19 weeks (5 phases)
- **Approach:** Build complete abstraction layer, plan for future scale
- **Best for:** Educational projects, research papers, long-term organizational adoption

**💡 Our Recommendation:**
Start with the MVP path ([`implementation_mvp.md`](implementation_mvp.md)). Ship persistent graphs in Week 1, validate with users, then selectively adopt pieces of this full architecture as proven necessary. This document serves as your **roadmap**, not your starting point.

**You can always evolve from MVP to Full Architecture later.** The reverse is much harder.

## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document is a **complete, standalone implementation guide** for the Kosmos persistent world model feature. A developer should be able to read this document and implement the entire feature without needing to reference other documents (though they are available for context).

### 1.2 How to Use This Document

**If you're implementing from scratch:**
1. Start with Section 2 (Development Environment Setup)
2. Follow phases sequentially: Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
3. For each phase, complete all sprints in order
4. Run tests after each sprint
5. Review acceptance criteria before moving to next phase

**If you're joining mid-implementation:**
1. Review the Complete File Structure (Section 8)
2. Jump to the relevant phase
3. Check prerequisites and dependencies for that phase
4. Follow the sprint tasks

**If you're fixing a bug or adding a feature:**
1. Find the relevant component in Section 8
2. Review the architecture patterns used (references provided)
3. Follow the testing strategy (Section 9)
4. Ensure changes maintain backward compatibility

### 1.3 Document Conventions

**Code Examples:**
- ✅ **Complete code** = Ready to copy-paste
- 🔧 **Pseudocode** = Logical structure, needs adaptation
- 📝 **Configuration** = YAML/JSON examples

**Task Estimates:**
- Days are **developer-days** (6-8 productive hours)
- Estimates include implementation + testing + documentation
- Story points: 1 point = 0.5 days, 2 points = 1 day, 3 points = 2 days

**Success Criteria:**
- Each sprint has acceptance criteria
- ✅ = Must be complete before moving forward
- ⭐ = Critical for phase success
- 💡 = Nice to have, can defer

### 1.4 The "All Three" Goals Reminder

Every implementation decision serves three goals simultaneously:

**Goal A: Faithful Reproduction**
Production Mode implements the polyglot architecture from the Kosmos paper

**Goal B: Practical Tool**
Simple Mode provides immediate value to individual researchers

**Goal C: Educational Reference**
Code teaches patterns, docs explain decisions, ADRs capture rationale

Keep these in mind when making implementation trade-offs.

Thank you for opening this issue! We've been thinking deeply about persistent
knowledge graphs for Kosmos, and your request aligns perfectly with our roadmap.

## What We're Planning

We're designing a **persistent world model** feature that will:

✅ Preserve knowledge graphs between research sessions
✅ Allow exporting/importing graphs for backup and sharing
✅ Support multiple research projects with isolated graphs
✅ Enable knowledge curation (verification, annotation, quality analysis)

## We Need Your Input

To ensure we build the right solution, we have some questions:

1. **Scale**: How many entities/papers do you typically work with?
   - [ ] <100 entities (small project)
   - [ ] 100-1,000 entities (medium project)
   - [ ] 1,000-10,000 entities (large project)
   - [ ] >10,000 entities (very large project)

2. **Workflow**: How would you use persistent graphs?
   - [ ] Build knowledge over weeks/months
   - [ ] Share graphs with collaborators
   - [ ] Export for version control
   - [ ] Curate and verify entities manually
   - [ ] Other: _______________

3. **Infrastructure**: What's your comfort level with DevOps?
   - [ ] Prefer minimal setup (just Docker)
   - [ ] Comfortable with Docker Compose
   - [ ] Can manage multiple database services
   - [ ] Have enterprise infrastructure available

4. **Priority Features**: Which features are most important? (rank 1-5)
   - [ ] Persistence across runs
   - [ ] Export/import functionality
   - [ ] Multi-project support
   - [ ] Knowledge curation tools
   - [ ] Semantic search

5. **Timeline**: When would you want to start using this?
   - [ ] As soon as basic persistence works
   - [ ] When curation features are ready
   - [ ] When it's production-ready
   - [ ] No rush, whenever it's ready

## Two Implementation Modes

We're planning to offer:

**Simple Mode (Default)**
- Single Neo4j database
- Works on a laptop
- 5-minute setup
- Handles 10K-50K entities
- Perfect for individual researchers

**Production Mode (Optional)**
- Multiple specialized databases
- Enterprise scalability
- Supports 100K+ entities
- Advanced features (semantic search, provenance tracking)
- For research organizations

Which mode would you use? Would you start with Simple and upgrade later?

## Next Steps

We'll:
1. Create a GitHub Discussion to gather broader community input
2. Validate that 10+ users want this feature
3. Begin implementation if there's sufficient interest

Looking forward to your feedback!
```

2. **Post comment** and tag the user
3. **Monitor responses** for 3-5 days
4. **Document feedback** in `docs/phase0/user_feedback.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Response posted to Issue #4
- ✅ User responds with answers
- ✅ Feedback documented

#### Task 3.1.2: Create GitHub Discussion (1 day)

**Objective:** Gather broader community input

**Steps:**

1. **Create discussion** in GitHub Discussions under "Ideas" category

2. **Use this template:**

```markdown
# [RFC] Persistent Knowledge Graphs for Kosmos

## Summary

We're proposing to add **persistent world models** to Kosmos, allowing knowledge
graphs to survive between research sessions.

## Problem

Currently, Kosmos builds a fresh knowledge graph for each research run. This means:
- ❌ Knowledge is lost between sessions
- ❌ No way to build expertise over time
- ❌ Can't share graphs with collaborators
- ❌ No ability to curate and verify findings

## Proposed Solution

Add persistent knowledge graph storage with two modes:

### Simple Mode (Default)
- Minimal setup (just Docker)
- Single Neo4j database
- Handles 10K-50K entities
- Export/import for backup

### Production Mode (Optional)
- Multiple specialized databases
- Enterprise scale (100K+ entities)
- Advanced features (semantic search, provenance)
- For research organizations

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1** (6 weeks): Simple Mode with persistence, export/import, basic CLI
**Phase 2** (4 weeks): Curation tools (verification, annotation, quality analysis)
**Phase 3** (3 weeks): Multi-project support
**Phase 4** (6 weeks): Production Mode with full feature set

## We Need Your Input!

Please answer these questions:

1. **Would you use persistent knowledge graphs?** Why or why not?

2. **What's your typical research workflow?**
   - Duration of projects (days? weeks? months?)
   - Number of papers you typically analyze
   - Do you collaborate with others?

3. **Which features matter most to you?**
   - [ ] Basic persistence
   - [ ] Export/import
   - [ ] Multi-project support
   - [ ] Curation/verification tools
   - [ ] Semantic search
   - [ ] Provenance tracking

4. **Infrastructure comfort level?**
   - [ ] Minimal (I just want it to work)
   - [ ] Docker Compose is fine
   - [ ] I can manage multiple services
   - [ ] I have enterprise infrastructure

5. **When would you want this?**
   - [ ] ASAP (even with basic features)
   - [ ] When it's polished
   - [ ] No rush

## Success Criteria

We'll proceed with implementation if:
- ✅ 10+ users express interest
- ✅ Clear use cases emerge
- ✅ Majority prefer Simple Mode approach

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Gather feedback
- **Week 2**: Finalize architecture
- **Week 3+**: Begin implementation if validated

- ✅ Entity, Relationship, Annotation models implemented
- ✅ All validation logic working
- ✅ Serialization (to_dict/from_dict) working
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Type hints complete
- ✅ Docstrings explain design rationale

#### Task 4.2.3: Implement Abstract Interfaces (Day 2-3, 2 days)

**Create `kosmos/world_model/interface.py`:**

```python
"""
Abstract interfaces for world model storage.

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN: Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)

This module defines the abstract interfaces that enable multiple storage
backends (Simple Mode vs Production Mode) without changing business logic.

KEY INTERFACES:
- WorldModelStorage: Core storage operations
- ProvenanceTracker: Provenance tracking (basic vs PROV-O)
- SemanticSearch: Similarity search (keyword vs vector)
- QueryEngine: Query execution (Cypher vs GraphRAG)

DESIGN RATIONALE:
Using ABCs follows the Dependency Inversion Principle (SOLID):
- High-level modules (agents) depend on abstractions (these interfaces)
- Low-level modules (Neo4j, PostgreSQL) implement abstractions
- Both can vary independently

See: docs/planning/architecture.md Section 3 (Architecture Principles)

**Acceptance Criteria for Sprint 1:**
- ✅ Data models (Entity, Relationship, Annotation) implemented and tested
- ✅ Abstract interfaces (WorldModelStorage, WorldModel) defined
- ✅ Error classes defined
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Type hints complete (mypy passes)
- ✅ Documentation explains design rationale

### 4.3 Sprint 2: Neo4j Persistence Implementation (Week 4)

**Duration:** 5 days
**Goal:** Implement Neo4jWorldModel (Simple Mode storage backend)
**Developers:** 2

#### Task 4.3.1: Implement Neo4j Storage Backend (Day 1-3, 3 days)

**Create `kosmos/world_model/simple.py`:**

This is a large file (~600 lines). Here's the complete implementation:

```python
"""
Neo4j-based world model storage (Simple Mode).

DESIGN RATIONALE:
Simple Mode uses a single Neo4j database for all storage needs.
This prioritizes simplicity and ease of setup over specialized performance.

TRADE-OFFS:
- Pros: Simple setup, one database to manage, sufficient for 90% of users
- Cons: Limited to ~10K-50K entities, slower than specialized systems

WHEN TO UPGRADE:
Consider Production Mode when:
- Graph exceeds 10K entities
- Query latency >1 second
- Need semantic search beyond keyword matching
- Require publication-quality provenance

See: docs/planning/architecture.md Section 5.2 (Components)
See: docs/architecture/adr/ADR-002-neo4j-simple-mode.md

        self.neo4j = neo4j
        self.es = elasticsearch
        self.vector_db = vector_db

    def add_entity(self, entity: Entity) -> str:
        # Transaction across all backends
        with self.postgres.transaction():
            # 1. Store in PostgreSQL (source of truth)
            self.postgres.insert_entity(entity)

            # 2. Store in Neo4j (graph operations)
            self.neo4j.create_node(entity)

            # 3. Index in Elasticsearch (provenance)
            self.es.index_entity(entity)

**Phase 1 Requirements:**
- ✅ 90%+ overall coverage
- ✅ 100% coverage for data models
- ✅ 95%+ coverage for storage implementations
- ✅ 85%+ coverage for CLI commands

**Measurement:**
```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=kosmos.world_model --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# View detailed report
open htmlcov/index.html

# Fail if coverage below 90%
poetry run pytest --cov=kosmos.world_model --cov-fail-under=90
```

### 9.2 Test Pyramid

```
         /\
        /  \  E2E Tests (10%)
       /────\
      /      \  Integration Tests (30%)
     /────────\
    /          \  Unit Tests (60%)
   /────────────\
```

**Unit Tests (60% of tests):**
- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Mock all external dependencies
- Fast (<1ms per test)
- Example: Entity validation, relationship creation

**Integration Tests (30% of tests):**
- Test component interactions with real dependencies
- Use test databases (Neo4j, PostgreSQL)
- Moderate speed (~100ms per test)
- Example: Add entity to Neo4j, verify it's stored

**E2E Tests (10% of tests):**
- Test complete user workflows
- All components working together
- Slower (~1s per test)
- Example: Export graph, reset, import, verify integrity

### 10.3 Backup and Restore

**Backup Script (`scripts/backup.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup world model data

BACKUP_DIR="./backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Export graph
kosmos graph export "$BACKUP_DIR/graph.json" --format json

# Backup Neo4j volume
docker run --rm \
  -v kosmos_neo4j_data:/data \
  -v "$PWD/$BACKUP_DIR":/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/neo4j_data.tar.gz /data

echo "Backup complete: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

**Restore Script (`scripts/restore.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Restore world model from backup

BACKUP_DIR=$1

if [ -z "$BACKUP_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./restore.sh <backup_dir>"
  exit 1
fi

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Restore Neo4j volume
docker run --rm \
  -v kosmos_neo4j_data:/data \
  -v "$PWD/$BACKUP_DIR":/backup \
  alpine sh -c "cd / && tar xzf /backup/neo4j_data.tar.gz"

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Import graph
kosmos graph import "$BACKUP_DIR/graph.json" --mode replace

echo "Restore complete"
```

### 10.4 Monitoring

**Health Check Endpoint:**

```python
# kosmos/cli/health.py
@click.command()
def health():
    """Check world model health."""
    try:
        world_model = WorldModelFactory.create(config)
        stats = world_model.get_info()
        click.echo("✅ World model healthy")
        click.echo(f"   Entities: {stats.entity_count}")
        click.echo(f"   Database: {stats.database}")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        click.echo(f"❌ World model unhealthy: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
```

**Prometheus Metrics (Production Mode):**

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

entity_operations = Counter(
    'world_model_entity_operations_total',
    'Total entity operations',
    ['operation']  # add, update, delete
)

query_duration = Histogram(
    'world_model_query_duration_seconds',
    'Query duration in seconds'
)

# Instrument operations
def add_entity(self, entity):
    entity_operations.labels(operation='add').inc()
    with query_duration.time():
        return self.storage.add_entity(entity)
```

## 12. Developer Guidelines

### 12.1 Code Style

**Follow these conventions:**

1. **PEP 8** for Python code style
2. **Type hints** for all function signatures
3. **Docstrings** for all public APIs (Google style)
4. **Comments** explain WHY, not WHAT
5. **Educational notes** for complex patterns

**Example:**

```python
def merge_entities(
    self, source_id: str, target_id: str, preserve_provenance: bool = True
) -> str:
    """
    Merge two entities into one.

    DESIGN RATIONALE:
    We preserve the target entity ID to maintain stable references.
    All relationships from source are moved to target.

    Args:
        source_id: Entity to merge from (will be deleted)
        target_id: Entity to merge into (will be kept)
        preserve_provenance: Whether to record merge in provenance

    Returns:
        ID of merged entity (same as target_id)

    Raises:
        EntityNotFoundError: If either entity doesn't exist

    Example:
        >>> merged_id = storage.merge_entities("old_id", "new_id")
        >>> assert merged_id == "new_id"
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### 12.2 Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:**

```
main (production-ready)
  ↑
develop (integration branch)
  ↑
feature/phase-1-foundation
feature/phase-2-curation
bugfix/export-unicode-handling
```

**Commit Message Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement

**Examples:**

```
feat(world_model): implement Neo4j persistence

- Add Neo4jWorldModel class
- Implement all WorldModelStorage methods
- Add schema initialization
- 90% test coverage

Closes #42
```

```
fix(export): handle unicode characters in entity properties

Entity properties containing unicode were causing JSON export to fail.
Added proper encoding handling.

Fixes #156
```

### 12.3 Pull Request Checklist

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] All tests passing (`poetry run pytest`)
- [ ] Code coverage ≥90% (`poetry run pytest --cov`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`poetry run mypy kosmos/world_model`)

- [ ] User guide updated if user-facing changes
- [ ] Architecture docs updated if design changes
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated

**Testing:**
- [ ] Unit tests for new code

- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error handling tested

**Review:**
- [ ] Self-reviewed code
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debugging print statements
- [ ] Educational comments added for complex logic

### 12.4 Common Patterns

**Error Handling:**

```python
# ✅ Good: Specific exceptions with context
try:
    entity = self.get_entity(entity_id)
    if not entity:
        raise EntityNotFoundError(entity_id)
except Neo4jError as e:
    raise WorldModelStorageError(f"Failed to retrieve entity: {e}") from e

# ❌ Bad: Bare except, no context
try:
    entity = self.get_entity(entity_id)
except:
    raise Exception("Error")
```

**Logging:**

```python
# ✅ Good: Structured logging with context
logger.info(
    "Entity created",
    extra={"entity_id": entity.id, "type": entity.type, "project": entity.project}
)

# ❌ Bad: String formatting, no structure
logger.info(f"Created entity {entity.id}")
```

**Configuration:**

```python
# ✅ Good: Use config objects, validate early
neo4j_url = config.world_model.simple.neo4j.url
if not neo4j_url:
    raise ValueError("Neo4j URL not configured")

# ❌ Bad: Environment variables everywhere, late validation
neo4j_url = os.getenv("NEO4J_URL")  # Might be None!
```

### 12.5 Getting Help

**Resources:**
- 📖 Read `docs/planning/architecture.md` for design decisions
- 📖 Read ADRs in `docs/architecture/adr/` for rationale
- 🐛 Check existing issues before creating new ones
- 💬 Ask in GitHub Discussions for design questions
- 📧 Email maintainers for security issues

**Before asking:**
1. Search existing issues and discussions
2. Read relevant documentation
3. Try to debug the issue yourself
