# Important Notes & Limitations

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What Works



1. **HTTP Proxy** - Correctly forwards HTTP requests


2. **HTTPS CONNECT Tunneling** - Establishes HTTPS tunnels for secure connections


3. **Multi-Domain Support** - Can proxy requests to any domain (not just Gemini API)


4. **API Key Replacement** - Replaces keys in headers and query parameters for Gemini API

### ⚠️ Current Limitation: HTTPS Content Inspection

**The proxy currently CANNOT inspect/modify HTTPS request content** after the CONNECT tunnel is established.

#### Why This Happens

When Antigravity makes an HTTPS request:



1. **CONNECT Request**: Browser sends `CONNECT generativelanguage.googleapis.com:443`


2. **Tunnel Created**: Proxy establishes a TCP tunnel between client and server


3. **TLS Handshake**: Client and server negotiate encryption **directly**


4. **Encrypted Traffic**: All subsequent data flows through the tunnel **encrypted**

The proxy only sees:


- ✅ Initial CONNECT request (domain + port)


- ❌ NOT the actual HTTPS request content (headers, body, URL path)

```

Client → [CONNECT tunnel] → Proxy → [CONNECT tunnel] → Server
         └─ Encrypted TLS traffic flows through ─┘
                    (proxy can't see inside)

```

#### What This Means

The proxy **cannot replace API keys in HTTPS requests** using this simple approach because:


- API keys are inside the encrypted TLS tunnel


- Proxy would need to perform TLS man-in-the-middle (MITM)


- MITM requires certificate generation and installation

### 🔧 Solutions

#### Option 1: Full MITM Proxy (Complex but Complete)

Implement proper MITM with certificate generation:

**Pros:**


- Can inspect and modify HTTPS traffic


- Can replace API keys in real-time


- Works transparently

**Cons:**


- Complex implementation (need to generate certificates on-the-fly)


- Requires installing root CA certificate in macOS Keychain


- Security implications (disables certificate verification)

**Implementation:**
Use existing MITM libraries:


- `mitmproxy` (Python - what we initially considered)


- `http-mitm-proxy` (Node.js)


- `node-mitmproxy` (Node.js)

#### Option 2: VS Code Extension (Simpler, More Direct)

Create a VS Code extension that hooks into Antigravity:

**Pros:**


- Direct access to API calls before encryption


- No certificate management needed


- Clean integration

**Cons:**


- Need to understand Antigravity's extension API


- May need to reverse-engineer their API calling mechanism


- Extension might break with Antigravity updates

#### Option 3: Binary Patching (Not Recommended)

Modify Antigravity's compiled code to change hardcoded API endpoints or keys.

**Pros:**


- Direct solution

**Cons:**


- Very fragile


- Breaks with updates


- Legally questionable


- Difficult to maintain

#### Option 4: Use Python mitmproxy (What We Should Have Done)

Go back to the original plan with `mitmproxy`:

**Setup:**

```bash

# Install mitmproxy

brew install mitmproxy

# Start with addon script

mitmproxy -s ~/dev/personal/antigravity-proxy/mitm-addon.py

# Install certificate

open ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem

# Add to Keychain and trust

# Launch Antigravity

HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 \
/Applications/Antigravity.app/Contents/MacOS/Antigravity

```

**Python addon script:**

```python
from mitmproxy import http

YOUR_API_KEY = "your_key_here"

def request(flow: http.HTTPFlow) -> None:
    if "generativelanguage.googleapis.com" in flow.request.pretty_host:
        # Replace API key
        if "x-goog-api-key" in flow.request.headers:
            flow.request.headers["x-goog-api-key"] = YOUR_API_KEY
        
        # Replace in URL
        if "key=" in flow.request.url:
            import re
            flow.request.url = re.sub(r'key=[^&]+', f'key={YOUR_API_KEY}', flow.request.url)

```

### 📊 Comparison

| Approach | Complexity | Effectiveness | Maintenance |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Current Node.js | Low | ❌ Doesn't work for HTTPS | Easy |
| Node.js MITM | Medium | ✅ Works | Medium |
| mitmproxy | Low | ✅ Works | Easy |
| VS Code Extension | High | ✅ Works | Hard |
| Binary Patching | Very High | ⚠️ Fragile | Very Hard |

### 🎯 Recommendation

**Use `mitmproxy`** - It's the industry-standard solution for exactly this use case:



1. **Proven**: Used by thousands of developers for API interception


2. **Simple**: Just install certificate and run


3. **Powerful**: Full Python scripting for request/response modification


4. **Well-Documented**: Extensive docs and examples


5. **Maintained**: Active open-source project

### 🚀 Next Step [OBSOLETE]s

If you want this to actually work, I recommend:



1. **Switch to mitmproxy** (30 minutes setup)


2. Or **implement full MITM in Node.js** using `node-mitmproxy` library (2-4 hours)


3. Or **create a VS Code extension** (1-2 days, requires reverse engineering)

Let me know which direction you want to go!

## Current Status

The current Node.js proxy:


- ✅ Demonstrates the concept


- ✅ Shows request flow and logging


- ✅ Works for HTTP requests


- ❌ **Does NOT work for HTTPS content inspection**


- ❌ **Cannot replace API keys in encrypted traffic**

This is essentially a learning/demonstration project that would need significant enhancement to actually work with Antigravity's HTTPS API calls.
